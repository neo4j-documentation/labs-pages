== What is Neo4j Labs?
Neo4j Labs is a collection of the latest innovations in graph technology.
These projects are designed and developed by the Neo4j team as a way to test functionality and extensions of our link:/product/?ref=labs[product offerings].
A project typically either graduates to being maintained as a formal Neo4j project or is deprecated with source made available publicly.

These Labs are supported via the link:https://community.neo4j.com/?_ga=2.65967848.79768660.1594637016-1548419832.1589810895[online community].
They are actively developed and maintained, but we don't provide any SLAs or guarantees around backwards compatibility and deprecation, see the FAQ below.


== Current Projects

[#goals.incremental]
=== xref:arrows:index.adoc[arrows.app]

A web-based tool for drawing pictures of graphs. Try it at link:https://arrows.app[arrows.app^]

=== xref:apoc:index.adoc[Awesome Procedures on Cypher (APOC)]

As the most comprehensive developer toolkit for Neo4j, the xref:apoc:index.adoc[APOC library] provides a wide range of procedures and functions that make your life as a Neo4j user easier.
APOC includes data integration, graph refactoring, data conversion, operational functionality and more.

=== xref:etl-tool:index.adoc[ETL Tool]

Having an easy way of loading data from relational databases into Neo4j is one of the first steps many users take.
The xref:etl-tool:index.adoc[Neo4j-ETL Tool] makes this easy by inferring a graph model from the relational meta model that you can then adapt to fit your needs.
Given that transformation, this tool also handles the actual import for you.

=== xref:grandstack-graphql:index.adoc[GraphQL and GRANDstack]

GraphQL has become a comprehensive stack for API development and consolidation.
Our link:https://www.grandstack.io[GRANDstack^] and Neo4j-GraphQL-js offerings combine the most common tools and frameworks: GraphQL, React, Apollo and Neo4j Database.

=== xref:halin:index.adoc[Halin Monitoring App]

The link:https://neo4j.com/labs/halin[Halin Monitoring App] allows you to monitor your Neo4j deployment and identify bottlenecks or incorrect configurations, with insights into currently running queries and workloads.
The app also provides access to metrics and logs.

=== xref:liquibase:index.adoc[Neo4j plugin for Liquibase]

Liquibase is an open source project for tracking, managing and applying database schema changes. The link:https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-neo4j[Neo4j plugin for Liquibase] allows you to define and execute changes against Neo4j, with all the features Liquibase supports.

=== xref:neo4j-helm:index.adoc[Neo4j-Helm]

xref:neo4j-helm:index.adoc[Neo4j-Helm] is a tool for configuring and deploying Neo4j instances on Kubernetes.  
By using the Helm package manager for Kubernetes, it makes it simple to specify advanced configurations of Neo4j, both standalone and cluster, and run them with Kubernetes across many cloud platforms.

=== xref:neo4j-migrations:index.adoc[Neo4j-Migrations]

xref:neo4j-migrations:index.adoc[Neo4j-Migrations] is a set of tools to make your schema migrations as easy as possible. 
It provides a uniform way for applications, the command line and build tools alike to track, manage and apply changes to your database.
It is inspired to a large extend by FlywayDB, so most things evolve around Cypher-Scripts. 
Neo4j-Migrations builds directly on top of the official Neo4j-Java-Driver, supports Neo4j from 3.5 up to 4.4, including enterprise features such as multidatabase support and impersonation.

=== xref:neosemantics:index.adoc[Neosemantics]

xref:neosemantics:index.adoc[Neosemantics] integrates RDF and Linked Data with Neo4j.
It allows to import a wide variety of RDF formats and to expose Neo4j property graphs as Linked Data.
Ontology and Inference are also partially supported.

=== xref:neodash:index.adoc[NeoDash]

xref:neodash:index.adoc[NeoDash] is an open-source, low-code Dashboard Builder for Neo4j. It lets you build an interactive dashboard with tables, graphs, bar charts, line charts, maps and more.

=== Other Active Projects

* link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neovis.js/[Neovis.js^], a graph visualization toolkit for the web

== Graduated Projects

The following projects were successfully developed, incubated, and validated within Neo4j Labs and have graduated to official and supported Neo4j products ready for production use at scale.

=== link:/graph-data-science[Graph Data Science Library]

To enable large scale graph analytics and support machine learning pipelines we developed the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library, which covers many widely used algorithms. The library offers highly parallelized implementations that work well with large scale graphs.
It graduated and is now available as part of the Neo4j Graph Platform as link:/graph-data-science[Graph Data Science Library]. link:/developer/graph-data-science[Educational content] is available from Neo4j Labs.

=== xref:kafka:index.adoc[Neo4j Connector for Apache Kafka]

Streaming event data is an integral part of most modern data architectures.
With the xref:kafka:index.adoc[Neo4j Connector for Apache Kafka] you can integrate Neo4j both as a sink or source into your setup.
The integration is available as a Kafka Connect plugin and Neo4j Server extension. It is officially supported as an Ecosystem Connector.

=== link:/developer/spark[Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark]

Data processing in Apache Spark is commonplace and available on all cloud platforms.
With the link:/developer/spark[Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark] you can read from and write to Neo4j from your Spark Jobs.
Built on the new DataSource API it supports usage from Python, R and Scala. It is officially supported as an Ecosystem Connector.

=== link:/developer/docker[Neo4j Docker Container]

The link:https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j[Neo4j Docker containers] started off as a Labs project to explore how well Neo4j would run in a containerized environment.
They quickly gained popularity and are heavily used by both Neo4j and customers, so we've graduated them to be officially part of the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/docker/[Neo4j release distribution].

== Frequently Asked Questions

=== Are these safe to use in production?
Current Neo4j Labs projects are being actively worked on by our engineers, and may be rough around the edges, with changing APIs, as they push the edge of the envelope. Therefore, we cannot provide official commercial support for these projects or guarantee longevity. However, some Neo4j customers and users still love the functionality of these projects and choose to continue using them in production environments.

=== How do I contribute?
We welcome contributions for those labs which are open source projects. You'll find links to GitHub repositories - feel free to submit PRs. We've also created a discussion category for Labs on link:https://community.neo4j.com[community.neo4j.com^]

=== Which Neo4j Labs projects have been deprecated?
The MongoDB Doc Manager and Cassandra Connector have both been deprecated. The source is still available on GitHub, but we found most developers could accomplish similiar goals by using APOC, Kafka and other technologies.
