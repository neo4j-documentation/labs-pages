== Introduction

Agent Neo is a Graph Retrieval-Augmentation Generation (Graph-RAG) chat application that leverages the Neo4j Label Property Graph to manage and query data. 
Developed initially using a high-quality dataset of Neo4j documentation, the application utilizes metadata enrichment and post-processing to enhance RAG response quality. 


== How It Works

The workflow for Agent Neo is outlined as follows:

. **Document Upload and Storage**: Documents are uploaded and stored as `Document` nodes within the graph.
. **Chunk Processing**: Documents are segmented into smaller chunks, then processed and stored as nodes, linked to their respective documents.
. **Topic Extraction and Clustering**: Topics are extracted using NLP post-processing, encoded, and linked to text chunks to form clusters.
. **Similarity and Graph Structuring**: Text embeddings are utilized to identify similar text chunks, which are interconnected using "SIMILAR_TO" relationships to further structure the graph via the Leiden algorithm.
. **Metadata Integration and Feedback Loop**: Session metadata and user feedback are integrated into the graph, enhancing data richness for future queries and analyses.

== Key enhancements

* Capturing session and conversation metadata along with their associated questions and responses, linking them back to relevant entries.
* Extracting topics using NLP techniques, encoding these into the graph, and associating them with corresponding text blocks to create a semantic hierarchy.
* Clustering topics and encoding similarity features within the graph, involving generating text embeddings for topics, conducting k-nearest neighbors analyses, and creating "SIMILAR_TO" relationships.
* Setting "SIMILAR_TO" relationships as undirected and aggregating similarity scores to apply the Leiden algorithm, subsequently forming Topic Groups that expand the semantic topic hierarchy.
* Injecting session UUIDs generated on the frontend, integrating these with LangSmith LLM logging, and writing back LangSmith metadata statistics into the graph.
* Capturing user response feedback through the UI and incorporating this into the graph to potentially inform response ranking and analyze application satisfaction.

== Why Graph RAG?

Agent Neo utilizes Graph-RAG technology to offer significant advantages:

* *Completeness of Responses*: Combines classical vector similarity searches with graph traversals to capture a broader context around text similarities beyond simple metric comparisons.
* *Explainability & Observability*: Enhances the transparency and explainability of operations by incorporating vectors within a graph structure, moving away from the "black box" nature of traditional models.
* *Rapid Iteration and Integration*: Facilitates quick iterations and seamless integration of diverse data sources through Neo4j’s Label Property Graph, supported by in-platform feature engineering capabilities.
