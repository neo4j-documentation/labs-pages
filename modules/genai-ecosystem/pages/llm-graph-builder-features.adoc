== Sources

=== Local file upload

You can drag & drop files into the first input zone on the left. The application will store the uploaded sources as Document nodes in the graph using LangChain Loaders (PDFLoader and Unstructured Loader).

|===
| File Type | Supported Extensions

| Microsoft Office | .docx, .pptx, .xls
| PDF | .pdf
| Images | .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .svg
| Text | .html, .txt, .md
|===

=== Web Links

The second input zone handles web links.

* YouTube transcripts
* Wikipedia pages
* Web Pages

The application will parse and store the uploaded YouTube videos (transcript) as a Document nodes in the graph using YouTube parsers.

For Wikipedia links we use the Wikipedia Loader. For example, you can provide `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j` and it will load the Neo4j Wikipedia page.

For web pages, we use the Unstructured Loader. For example, you can provide articles from `https://theguardian.com/` and it will load the article content.

== Cloud Storage

=== AWS S3

This AWS S3 integration allows you to connect to an S3 bucket and load the files from there. You will need to provide your AWS credentials and the bucket name.

=== Google Cloud Storage

This Google Cloud Storage integration allows you to connect to a GCS bucket and load the files from there. You will have provide your GCS bucket name and optionally a folder an follow an auth flow to give the application access to the bucket.

== LLM Models

The application uses ML models to transform PDFs, web pages, and YouTube video transcripts into a knowledge graph of entities and their relationships. ENV variables can be set to configure/enable/disable specific models.

The following models are configured (but only the first 3 are available in the publicly hosted version)

* OpenAI GPT 3.5 and 4o
* VertexAI (Gemini 1.0), 
* Diffbot
* Bedrock, 
* Anthropic
* OpenAI API compatible models like Ollama, Groq, Fireworks

The selected LLM model will both be used for processing the newly uploaded files and for powering the chatbot. Please note that the models have different capabilities, so they will work not equally well especially for extraction.

== Graph Enhancements

=== Graph Schema

If you want to use a pre-defined or your own graph schema, you can do so in the Graph Enhancements popup. This is also shown the first time you construct a graph and the state of the model configuration is listed below the connection information.

 You can either:
 * select a pre-defined schema from the dropdown on top,
 * use your own by entering the node labels and relationships, 
 * fetch the existing schema from an existing Neo4j database (`Use Existing Schema`), 
 * or copy/paste a text or schema description (also works with RDF ontologies or Cypher/GQL schema) and ask the LLM to analyze it and come up with a suggested schema (`Get Schema From Text`).

=== Delete Disconnected Nodes

When extracting entities, it can happen that after the extraction a number of nodes are only connected to text chunks but not to other entities. 
Which results to disconnected entities in the entity graph.

While they can hold relevant information for question answering they might affect your downstream usage. So in this view you can select which of the entities that are only connected to text chunks should be deleted.

////
=== Merging Duplicate Entities

While the prompt instructs the LLM to extract unique identifier for entities, across chunks and documents the same entity can end up with different spellings as duplicate in the graph.

Here we use a mixture of entity embedding, edit distance and substring containment to generate a list of potentially duplicate entities that can be merged.

You can select which sets of entities should be merged and exclude certain entities from the merge.

== Chatbot

=== How it works

When the user asks a question, we use the configured RAG mode to answer it with the data from the graph of extracted documents. That can mean the question is turned into an embedding or a graph query or a more advanced RAG approach.

We also summarize the chat history and use it as an element to enrich the context.

=== Features

- *Select RAG Mode* you can select vector-only or GraphRAG (vector+graph) modes
- *Clear chat:* Will delete the current session's chat history.
- *Expand view:* Will open the chatbot interface in a fullscreen mode.
- *Details:* Will open a Retrieval information pop-up showing details on how the RAG agent collected and used sources (documents), chunks, and entities. Also provides information on the model used and the token consumption.
- *Copy:* Will copy the content of the response to the clipboard.
- *Text-To-Speech:* Will read out loud the content of the response.

=== GraphRAG

For GraphRAG we use the Neo4j Vector Index (and a fulltext index for hybrid search) with a Retrieval Query to find the most relevant chunks and entities connected to these and then follow the entity relationships up to a depth of 2 hops.

=== Vectory Only RAG

For Vector only RAG we only use the vector and fulltext index (hybrid) search results and don't include additional information from the entity graph.

=== Answer Generation

The various inputs and determined sources (the question, vector results, entities (name + description), relationship pairs, chat history) are all sent to the selected LLM model as context information in a custom prompt, asking to provide and format a response to the question asked based on the elements and context provided. 

Of course, there is more magic to the prompt such as formatting, asking to cite sources, not speculating if the answer is not known, etc. The full prompt and instructions can be found in the https://github.com/neo4j-labs/llm-graph-builder[GitHub repository^].
