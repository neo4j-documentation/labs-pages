Knowledge Graphs can provide rich context to ground Large Language Models (LLMs) for enabling GenAI applications using Graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
The real world data captured in the graph avoids hallucination and provides a rich source of information for the LLMs to generate answers, summaries and suggestions from.

LLMs can be used to extract entities and their relationships from unstructured text to build up and enrich knowledge graphs.

The Neo4j GenAI Ecosystem is a collection of tools and integrations that make it easy to use LLMs with Neo4j.
