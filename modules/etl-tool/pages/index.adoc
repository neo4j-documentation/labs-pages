Many people want to import the data from their relational systems into Neo4j.
The Neo4j ETL tool was developed to make this initial import straightforward.

It extracts the schema from any relational database and allows you to turn it into the graph schema you need.

Then it takes care of importing the data into your graph either in bulk or online mode.
You don't need to know Cypher to use this tool, it takes care of all the heavy-lifting.

This allows you to explore datasets that you already know as a graph.
